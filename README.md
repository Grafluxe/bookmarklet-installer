# Bookmarklet Installer

This service helps you to share your bookmarklets easily and quickly. All you need is a link to your minified JS file; the rest is handled automatically.

## Goal

I wanted to create something that is:

- Easy for a bookmarklet author to use in order to share his/her bookmarklet.
- Clear for visitors to use in order to install the bookmarklet.

Note that I purposefully kept the styling and color palette minimal, so to not impose my design opinion.

## How To Use

To create a URL to share your bookmarklet, define the bookmarklets *title* (optional) and a *path* to where your minified bookmarket code is hosted. The *path* should be [URL encoded](http://www.url-encode-decode.com/).

```
http://grafluxe.com/asset/bmk?title=similar-imgs&path=bit.ly%2F2hx1n73
```

To above example is hosted on my site. Feel free to use my site, or serve from your own. Also, the bookmarklet I'm sharing can be found [here](https://github.com/Grafluxe/similar-imgs).

## Sample

Install the [Similar Image Searcher](http://grafluxe.com/asset/bmk?title=similar-imgs&path=bit.ly%2F2hx1n73) bookmarklet. Further instructions are on the install page.
